## 🎤 Elevator Pitch

### 30-Second Version
"Impactly is a white-label platform that lets nonprofits create their own branded mobile app in minutes. Volunteers get a beautiful app to discover events, register, and track their impact. Nonprofits get powerful tools to manage everything. Think Shopify, but for nonprofit volunteer management."

### 2-Minute Version
"Every nonprofit deserves great technology, but custom mobile apps cost $50k+ and take months to build. 

We built Impactly to change that. It's a white-label platform where any nonprofit can create their own branded mobile app in under an hour—no code required.

Here's how it works: A nonprofit signs up, uploads their logo and brand colors, and gets a fully functional mobile app. Their volunteers download the app and can discover events, register with a tap, get QR codes for check-in, and see their impact over time.

On the admin side, nonprofits get a powerful dashboard to create events, manage volunteers, track check-ins, and see analytics—all in real-time.

We started this because we built exactly this system for Doce25, an ocean cleanup nonprofit in Puerto Rico. They went from managing 50 volunteers in spreadsheets to 1000+ volunteers with a beautiful app. Now we're making this available to every nonprofit.

We're starting at just $49/month, with a free tier for small organizations. Our goal is to power 1,000 nonprofits in the first year."
